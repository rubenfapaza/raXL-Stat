**raXL Stat is an add-in for Microsoft Excel that turns your favorite spreadsheet into a quantitative and predictive analysis software, offering a collection of functions to create statistical, econometric, financial and mathematical models.** You can call these functions directly from a spreadsheet and they will return the modeling results directly to it.

raXL Stat is a statistical analysis software that will offer[^2] easy-to-use tools to perform and deliver quality work in a short time. It is developed[^3] to be used by both beginners and experts. The easiest and most intuitive way to run the functions is through the ribbon menu. If necessary, the user can directly write the functions in the spreadsheet cells or can invoke the functions from VBA (Visual Basic for Application) programming.

A feature of raXL Stat is that it does not require installation (portable .xll file), it integrates seamlessly with Excel with new User Defined Functions (UDF), automated charts, a rich set of shortcuts and an intuitive user interface for use. It integrates with the version of Excel you have installed on your Personal Computer (PC), not the Windows version.

With the raXL Stat v.0.4 [Beta] add-in you can do the following:
- Calculate and graph the Autocorrelation Function (**ACF**).
- Calculate and graph the Partial Autocorrelation Function (**PACF**).
- Perform the White Noise and independence test with the **Ljung-Box** or **Box-Pierce** test.
- Perform the Unit Root and Stationarity test with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (**ADF**) or Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (**KPSS**) test.
- Calculate coefficients, estimate, forecast, and graph the **ARIMA(p,d,q)** models, i.e., AR(p), MA(q), and ARMA(p,q).
- Calculate coefficients, estimate, forecast, and graph the ARCH(p) and **GARCH(p,q)** models.
- Create a table of ranges (Bins) and frequencies to graph **Histogram** with a cumulative curve or the normal curve.
- Create a table of quartiles to graph the **Box plot** with outliers.
- Perform the Normality test with the **Shapiro-Wilk**, **Anderson-Darling** and **Jarque-Bera** tests.
- Create a table with **Descriptive Statistics** with a normality test.
- Create a table with a **Covariance** matrix and a **Correlation Coefficient** matrix with the options of coefficients of determination (R^2) or a test that there is no correlation (R=0).
- Count **missing data**, blank or lost data in a data range.
- Create the **Scatter plot matrix**.
- Calculate and graph the Value at Risk (**VaR**) of an investment portfolio.
- Perform **Backtesting** with z and LR-Kupiec test.
-	Calculate the **weights, risk and return** of an investment portfolio.
-	Calculate the **minimum variance and tangency** weights of an investment portfolio.
-	Calculate and graph the **Efficient Portfolio Frontier** (EPF) and the **Capital Market Line** (CML) of an investment portfolio.
-	Run a point **simulation** of an investment portfolio for the Efficient Frontier.
-	Heteroscedasticity test: **ARCH Test**.
-	Calculate mean and standard deviation for the **Geometric Brownian Motion** (GBM) model.
-	Perform **GBM simulation** for the Geometric Brownian Motion model.
-	Create the **Band Chart** style Fan chart.
-	Perform **data manipulation** for Rates of Change, Natural Logarithm or Differentiation for time series.
-	Multiple and simple **linear regression**, coefficient estimation, fittid (Predict), and forecasting with confidence intervals (UDF only)
-	Version 0.4.1 [Beta]: No longer has a trial version.

[^2]: raXL Stat version v.0[Beta] is a test version to which new public functions will be added.

[^4]: The ARIMA and GARCH functions use the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method together with the Newton-Raphson (NR) optimization algorithm, however, other optimization methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt, BHHH, BFGS and others will be added in development.
